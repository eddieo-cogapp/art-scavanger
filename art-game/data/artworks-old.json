At the junction with Preston Drove, turn left (northwest) and walk exactly 450 meters until you spot the Church of the Good Shepherd on your right side - a distinctive Gothic Revival stone building with pointed arch windows and a square bell tower topped with a cross. From this second landmark (263,133 meters away), continue northwest for precisely 200 meters, then turn right (northeast) onto a residential street lined with characteristic Victorian terraced houses. Walk 150 meters north until you locate a three-story Victorian terrace building constructed of yellow London brick with white-painted window frames, decorative cornicing, and a black front door with fanlight. On the building's north-facing wall, you will find \"Woodpecker and Bee\" - a 2022 painted street art mural executed in vibrant acrylic paint, depicting a realistic red-headed woodpecker perched beside a detailed honey bee against a natural backdrop of tree bark and flowers.

Turn right (northeast) onto Surrenden Road and continue for 230 meters, passing rows of Victorian terraced houses with characteristic red brick facades and bay windows.

The converted residential building housing the artwork stands 45 meters before reaching the community garden on your right (east) side - a two-story Victorian terraced house painted white with a dark blue front door, featuring the original sash windows and decorative cornicing. \"The Only Lie\" (2024) is painted directly onto the building's north-facing side wall in vibrant acrylics, depicting large-scale figurative imagery with bold street art styling, incorporating realistic human forms rendered in contemporary graffiti techniques with flowing letterforms and urban color palette of blues, reds, and yellows against a stark white background, measuring approximately 4 meters high by 6 meters wide across the entire gable end wall.",
